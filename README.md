## Hi there 👋

👩‍💻 About Me
Hi there! I'm a Finite Element Simulation Engineer with a passion for thermal and CFD simulations. Whether it's tackling challenging internal flow dynamics, simulating thermal runaway in batteries, or optimizing complex geometries, I thrive on solving problems that push the boundaries of engineering.

📍 Currently Based In: Germany 🇩🇪 | Origin: India 🇮🇳
💼 Specialization: FEM, CFD, thermal simulations, and material modeling.
🎯 Current Goal: Transition into the exciting world of fuel cell stack development engineering.

🌟 What Drives Me
Attention to Detail: My work and personal life reflect a deep love for perfection, order, and alignment—whether it’s simulations or straightening doormats at home!
Problem Solver: From debugging CFD setups to handling buckling issues in Abaqus, I enjoy tackling tough challenges head-on.
Innovation: Always on the lookout for creative solutions, like improving flow dynamics or reducing outlet concentrations with clever bypass designs.
📚 Always Learning
I’m constantly expanding my skill set. Currently, I’m exploring:

Advanced CFD techniques (e.g., turbulent flows, condensation, EMP modeling)
Material modeling in Abaqus (e.g., hyperelasticity and hyperfoam materials)
Experimenting with coding and web development as a personal interest.
🤝 Collaboration
I’m a team player who thrives in collaborative environments. Whether it’s with my colleagues or clients, I believe in clear communication and delivering results—even when simulations get tricky! Fun fact: My team uses the "du" form, which reflects our friendly and casual communication style.

🌸 Outside Work
When I’m not deep in simulations, you’ll find me:

Practicing Ving Tsung martial arts 🥋
Exploring fragrances (ask me about unisex perfumes under €20!)
Enjoying newlywed life with my husband 💕 and planning our future adventures.
📫 Let's Connect!
I’m always open to connecting with like-minded engineers or learning about exciting opportunities. Feel free to reach out or collaborate on projects related to simulation, battery technology, or thermal systems!
